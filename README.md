# Hello and welcome!
I'm Terry Ming and welcome to my second home, where everything from my full-fledged projects to semi-organized jumbles of musings about data science and machine learning are located.

I am a senior undergraduate applied math and stats / data science student at UCLA. My research interests include deep learning (in particular NLP and scaling), ML fairness, explainability, machine unlearning, generative models, graph networks,  interdisciplinary data science and applications like climate analysis, etc.

I have a [personal website](https://terru3.github.io/), and I'm also working on some exciting data and ML projects. Feel free to read what I've been up to or contact me for more details / project pitches! I am actively seeking full-time opportunities beginning Summer 2024.

In my free time, I like to play piano, read fiction novels, go to art museums, play Rocket League, work out, listen to music, and more.
