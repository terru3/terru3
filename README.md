# Hello and welcome!
I'm Terry Ming and welcome to my second home, where everything from my full-fledged projects to semi-organized jumbles of musings about data science and machine learning will be located.

I am a current undergraduate applied mathematics and statistics + data science student at UCLA. My academic and research interests include deep learning, in particular in areas such as NLP, graph networks, ML fairness, and generative models. I am also interested in data science and analytics, time series analysis, climate and sustainability, and more. 

I am in the process of creating my own personal website (inactive), and I'm also working on some exciting data and ML projects. Feel free to read what I've been up to or contact me for more details / about project ideas!

In my free time, I like to play classical piano, read fiction, play Rocket League, work out, listen to music, go for runs, and more.
