# Hello and welcome!
I'm Terry Ming and welcome to my second home, where everything from my full-fledged projects to semi-organized jumbles of musings about data science and machine learning will be located.

I am a senior undergraduate applied math and stats / data science student at UCLA. My academic and research interests include deep learning, in particular NLP and scaling, ML fairness, explainability, machine unlearning, generative models, and graph networks. I am also interested in time series analysis, climate and sustainability, and more. 

I am in the process of creating my own personal website, and I'm also always working on some exciting data and ML projects. Feel free to read what I've been up to or contact me for more details / for project pitches!

In my free time, I like to play piano, read fiction novels, go to modern art museums, play Rocket League, work out, listen to music, and more.
