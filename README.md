# Hello and welcome!
My name is Terry Ming and this is my second home, where everything from my full-fledged projects to organized jumbles of musings about data science and machine learning will be located. Currently, as you can see, there's nothing, but you may anticipate more content to show up here in the coming months. In the meantime, feel free to read what I've been up to!

I am a current undergraduate applied mathematics and statistics student at UCLA. I have interests in data science and analytics, data visualisation, time series analysis, machine learning from ensemble methods to neural networks, database design/management, financial modelling, and more. 

I'm currently learning a wide variety of programming languages and frameworks such as Python, R, C++, SQL, HTML and CSS, and open to possibly delving into more such as Javascript and MongoDB, Swift, etc.
