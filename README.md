# Hello and welcome!
I'm Terry Ming and welcome to my second home, where everything from my full-fledged projects to semi-organized jumbles of musings about data science and machine learning are located.

I am a data scientist at Cashmere, developing the core discovery and matching algorithms that help wealth advisors find their next client. I am also a recent applied math and statistics graduate from UCLA. My research interests include deep learning (in particular NLP and scaling), ML fairness, explainability, machine unlearning, generative models, graph networks,  interdisciplinary data science and applications.

I have a [personal website](https://terru3.github.io/), and I'm also working on some exciting data and ML projects. Feel free to read what I've been up to or contact me for more details / project pitches!

In my free time, I like to play piano, read fiction novels, go to art museums, play Rocket League, work out, listen to music, and more.
