# Hello and welcome!
My name is Terry Ming and this is my second home, where everything from my full-fledged projects to organized jumbles of musings about data science and machine learning will be located. Currently, as you can see, there's nothing, but that will change pretty soon. I hope. In the meantime, feel free to read what I've been up to!

I am a current undergraduate applied mathematics and statistics student at UCLA. I have interests in data science and analytics, data visualisation, time series analysis, machine learning from ensemble methods to neural networks, database design/management, data applications in  financial modelling, actuarial science, astrophysics, and more. 

I'm currently learning a wide variety of programming languages and frameworks such as Python, R, C++, SQL, HTML and CSS, and open to acquainting myself with more such as Javascript and MongoDB, Swift, etc. I am in the process of creating my own personal website (linked below), and I also aim to dive into some real-world data projects in the coming months.

In my free time, apart from learning code, I like to play the piano, read fiction novels, play Rocket League, go for runs, and travel!
