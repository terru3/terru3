# Hello and welcome!
I'm Terry Ming and welcome to my second home, where everything from my full-fledged projects to organized jumbles of musings about data science and machine learning will be located.

I am a current undergraduate applied mathematics and statistics student at UCLA. My academic and research interests include data science and analytics, data visualisation, time series analysis, machine learning, NLP, database design/management, data applications in financial modelling, sustainability, and more. 

I am in the process of creating my own personal website, and I'm also working on some real-world data projects. Feel free to read what I've been up to!

In my free time, I like to play the piano, read fiction, play Rocket League, listen to music, go for runs, and more.
