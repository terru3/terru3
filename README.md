# Hello and welcome!
My name is Terry Ming and this is my second home, where everything from my full-fledged projects to organized jumbles of musings about data science and machine learning will be located. Feel free to read what I've been up to!

I am a current undergraduate applied mathematics and statistics student at UCLA. I have interests in data science and analytics, data visualisation, time series analysis, machine learning, NLP, database design/management, data applications in financial modelling and more. 

I'm mostly a Python kind of guy, but I'm currently learning a wide variety of programming tools such as R, C++, SQL, HTML/CSS, and open to acquainting myself with more of the modern data engineering/analytics stack such as Spark, Airflow, dbt, Redis, etc. I am in the process of creating my own personal website (linked below), and I also aim to dive into some real-world data projects in the coming months!

In my free time, I like to play the piano, read fiction novels, play Rocket League, go for runs, and more.
